# KnightLight

DMX Lighting control software. Made to have the individual channels visible and changeable, but still having a relatively easy user interface.
This is a personal project that I've made public mostly for ease of sharing with friends.
Trust me, the code is a mess and contains 10 years of learning different techniques, sometimes better and sometimes overcomplicated.

Enttec OpenDMX hardware works, as well as my own custom Arduino DMX Controller.

Actual v4 application exe is in KnightLight v4/bin/Debug/
